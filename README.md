# Countdown Browser Source

A basic countdown browser source for OBS and other applications. To add it on OBS, SLOBS, or other apps please add a new `Browser Source` and use `https://countdown-browser-source.herokuapp.com/?hours=24` as the `URL`.

It just accept hours for now, but will add support to just add minutes or seconds.
Happy streaming, and don't forget to follow me on Twitch at [twitch.tv/itsprof](https://twitch.tv/itsprof).
