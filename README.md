# Countdown Browser Source

A basic countdown browser source for OBS and other applications. To add it on OBS, SLOBS, or other apps please add a new `Browser Source` and use `https://countdown-browser-source.herokuapp.com/?hours=24` as the `URL`.

You can chnage the number of hours to match the amount you need.

It just accepts hours for now, but will add support to just add minutes or seconds.
Happy streaming, and don't forget to follow me on Twitch at [twitch.tv/itsprof](https://twitch.tv/itsprof).
